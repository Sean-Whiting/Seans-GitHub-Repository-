#Docker is an important tool, installing docker on my servers is allowing me to be able to distribute software.
#pip3 installs and manages software packages.
#dvwa stands for damn vulnerable web server, this is the website that my servers are running.
#Uninstalling apache3 was important because it will interfere with how docker works.
